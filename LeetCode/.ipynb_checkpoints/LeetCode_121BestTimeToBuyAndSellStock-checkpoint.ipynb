    "    Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]\n",
    "    Output: 5\n",
    "    Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.\n",
    "                 Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Input: [7,6,4,3,1]\n",
    "    Output: 0\n",
    "    Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0."
