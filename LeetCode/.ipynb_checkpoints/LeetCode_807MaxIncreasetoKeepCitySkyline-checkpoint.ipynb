    "https://leetcode.com/problems/max-increase-to-keep-city-skyline/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    In a 2 dimensional array grid, each value grid[i][j] represents the height of a building located there. We are allowed to increase the height of any number of buildings, by any amount (the amounts can be different for different buildings). Height 0 is considered to be a building as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "    At the end, the \"skyline\" when viewed from all four directions of the grid, i.e. top, bottom, left, and right, must be the same as the skyline of the original grid. A city's skyline is the outer contour of the rectangles formed by all the buildings when viewed from a distance. See the following example.\n",
    "\n",
    "    What is the maximum total sum that the height of the buildings can be increased?\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: grid = [[3,0,8,4],[2,4,5,7],[9,2,6,3],[0,3,1,0]]\n",
    "    Output: 35\n",
    "    Explanation: \n",
    "    The grid is:\n",
    "    [ [3, 0, 8, 4], \n",
    "      [2, 4, 5, 7],\n",
    "      [9, 2, 6, 3],\n",
    "      [0, 3, 1, 0] ]\n",
    "\n",
    "    The skyline viewed from top or bottom is: [9, 4, 8, 7]\n",
    "    The skyline viewed from left or right is: [8, 7, 9, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "    The grid after increasing the height of buildings without affecting skylines is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    gridNew = [ [8, 4, 8, 7],\n",
    "                [7, 4, 7, 7],\n",
    "                [9, 4, 8, 7],\n",
    "                [3, 3, 3, 3] ]\n",
    "\n",
    "   Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1 < grid.length = grid[0].length <= 50.\n",
    "    All heights grid[i][j] are in the range [0, 100].\n",
    "    All buildings in grid[i][j] occupy the entire grid cell: that is, they are a 1 x 1 x grid[i][j] rectangular prism.https://leetcode.com/problems/max-increase-to-keep-city-skyline/"
