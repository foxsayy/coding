    "\n",
    "    Your are given an array of integers prices, for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i; and a non-negative integer fee representing a transaction fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction. You may not buy more than 1 share of a stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Return the maximum profit you can make.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Input: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2\n",
    "    Output: 8\n",

    "\n",
    "    Buying at prices[0] = 1\n",
    "    Selling at prices[3] = 8\n",
    "    Buying at prices[4] = 4\n",
    "    Selling at prices[5] = 9\n",
    "    The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.\n",

    "    0 < prices[i] < 50000.\n",
